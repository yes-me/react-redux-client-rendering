## Installing and Running

npm install

# Start the Server
gulp

# If you want to edit the react code, this rebuilds
gulp watch
```

> The server will be available at localhost:3000

If you want to edit the React code, you'll have to re-build the `public/js/bundle.js` file with Webpack. You'll probably want to open a new terminal tab so you can keep your server running. To rebuild with Webpack, type:

```sh
gulp watch
